# Overview

This entire project was for me to learn how Functions, Classes, and Variables all
interacted with each other when I program in the Kotlin Language. This is basically
most of the logic needed for when I want to turn this into a basic mobile app game. 

This project has a main function use some classes to make two types of objects to 
interact with. One of the classes actually calls a separate function to fill one
of its arguments. Then the program goes through some while loops and if statements
so the user can use the program as long as they want.

This project is more of basic knowledge of how Kotlin works and prep for when I
make a mobile app with this.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

* IntelliJ
* Kotlin, basis of this project
* Git / GitHub, where I store my work.
* Java Scanner, so I can use the randomizer function

# Future Work
* When turning it into an app, know how to do touch commands
* Make it interactive with the probability to fail running away
* Make it interactive and have the encounter attack the player
